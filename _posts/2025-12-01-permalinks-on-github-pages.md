# Code Permalinks on Github Pages
A goal for my GitHub Pages blog is to be as lightweight and minimal as possible. The more the framework gets out of the way and allows me to put ideas on paper the better. 

I do a fair bit of coding and want to use GitHub more to organize my code. What better way to do write about that code than to link directly to it? A quick Google search led me to this [post](https://www.stevemar.net/github-code-in-readme/) that explains how to use permalinks to show code snippets. 

Now let's see if it is compatible with my GitHub Pages blog and the Jekyll minima theme I use. Let's link to a random code sample from the Python website's repo.
